# CV_2020_G35
This is for our CV 2020 challenge project. During this COVID-19 pandemic we cannot meet each other. So we will exchange our code and idea here in github in order to co-work more efficiently.
The project is about face recognition and image processing. We will separate moving people and still background from images by different cameras first. Next we edit the images according to the given mode. In the end we convert multiple images to a video file as output. The original images can be found here http://arma.sourceforge.net/chokepoint/#download.
