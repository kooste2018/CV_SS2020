# CV_2020_G35
This is a brief introduction for our Computer Vision Challenge SS2020 project. During this COVID-19 pandemic we cannot meet each other. So we will exchange our code and idea here in github in order to co-work more efficiently.The project is about face recognition and image processing. We will separate moving people(foreground) and still background from thousands of RGB images by using 3 frame method first. Next we edit the images according to the given mode. In the end we convert multiple images to a video file as output. The original images can be found here http://arma.sourceforge.net/chokepoint/#download. To simplify using the program and to enhance user experience we design a graphic user interface, where one can change many parameters for the program, such as a different virtual background, to get another output video.
